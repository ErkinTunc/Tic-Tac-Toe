# Tic Tac Toe

This is a **classic Tic Tac Toe game** I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It runs entirely in the browser and was a great way to bring together everything I’ve learned about front-end development so far.

## What I Built & Learned

This project helped me practice core web development skills:

- Selecting and updating elements in the **DOM**
- Handling **clicks, forms, and events**
- Using `event.preventDefault()` and `FormData` for user input
- Managing game state with **arrays, loops, and conditionals**
- Writing the **game logic** to check for winners, handle draws, and reset the board

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Set player names with the **Edit** buttons.
3. Click **Start New Game**.
4. Take turns marking the board.
5. The game will announce a **winner** or a **draw**.

## Why This Project Matters

This wasn’t just about making a game — it was about **connecting concepts**:

- Variables, functions, and loops
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Basic algorithms

It’s a small game, but it represents **real coding knowledge** coming together.

## Future Improvements

I plan to keep this project growing. Some ideas:

- **AI Opponent** – Play against the computer with simple or smart difficulty levels
- **Score Tracking** – Keep track of wins, losses, and draws over multiple games
- **Animations & Sound Effects** – Add some life to the moves and game over screen
- **Mobile Optimizations** – Make the layout even smoother on smaller screens
- **Theme Selector** – Switch between light, dark, or colorful themes
